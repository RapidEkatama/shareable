### On this file contain script to convert coco/xml file to YOLO. This data engineer project based on object detection and image segmentation model Ultralytics. The image processor that I use is from OpenCV.org. I also included the xml file example to understand the script (xml-to-yolo.py) access to annotation data

### I hope this helps you and I really look forward to corrections to get faster processing times and easier to understand lines of code
